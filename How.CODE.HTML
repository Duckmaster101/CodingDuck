<h1><center>Your Guide to learn the Basics of HTML</center>
Here is how you code HTML: first once you make your code file start with the < html > and < /html > to open the whole code(without this part the code will not work). Second part is the < head > and < /head > this part is mostly used for the < style > part whitch can change the background color and any words you want above the main text. Third the body after you make the < head > and < /head > add the < body > and < /body > in the body most of the coding happens. If you want a heading for the body add a < center > and < h1 > part but remeber to close it by adding a "/" befor the word after the words you want are centered. And also all of these < head > and < body > parts are all within the < html > and < /html > parts EX:<br>
 < html ><br>
 < head ><br>
